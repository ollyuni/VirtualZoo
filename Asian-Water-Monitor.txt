This page is for the Asian Water Monitor. It will be connected to the other pages with a 
navigation system.

The main page will be split into two columns. This will allow for text to be displayed inline
with an image or video.

On opening the page a clip of an asian water monitor will begin playing on the left size of the
page, on the right there will be a short, easy to read blurb about the Asian water monitor.
